Its GDP per capita has surpassed the likes of China, the US, and other developed countries</p><p>Over 6 decades, Singapore has transformed from a colonial trading port that has very few land and natural resources. But after its independence in 1965, the former British colony was transformed into a major manufacturing and financial centre that’s envied the world over. And it became an example for any country seeking to grow a robust, high-tech economy. Its wealth is the result of a decade of planning by a party that’s been in power since independence.</p><p>"Some of the biggest sectors domestically — shipbuilding, electronics, banking, and now they're very involved in private banking — got their start because Lee Kuan Yew and the government specially directed state funds into those areas," says Josh Kurlantzick of the Council on Foreign Relations.</p><p>What’s the history behind Singapore's success?</p><ol><li>Lee Kuan Yew’s strategy</li></ol><p>Since the independence, the first prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, and other founding members faced a huge obstacle which was that there were natural resources, so if they wanted to become an export-led economy and attract foreign capital, they needed to build up the country’s manufacturing industry as a stepping stone to a more developed country. Thus with its focus on labour-intensive industries, this helps wipe out the high unemployment in the starting period. Fortunately, the Singapore location is between the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea, which makes it a pivotal shipping hub.</p><ol><li>Finance transformation</li></ol><p>In the 1980s, Lee laid the fundamentals for what is now Singapore’s biggest source of wealth, finance. Following the lead of places like the US and the UK, Lee liberalized the financial services industry with lighter-touch regulations. The legacy of that approach is evident today.</p><p>"If you compare the conditions of people in a place like Singapore with the conditions of people in a place like red China or for that matter Indonesia, you will see that economic freedom is a very important component of total freedom," Late conservative economist Milton Friedman said on Free to Choose, a TV series first broadcast on PBS in 1980. Low taxes, few capital restrictions and liberal immigration policies have made it one of the most cosmopolitan places on Earth. "They have very, very free trade, very low tariffs [and] very few non-tariff barriers," says Kurlantzick. "They'll boast about how you can start your own company in Singapore in three hours." Now approximately 4200 multinational companies have regional headquarters here.</p><p>This is also made possible by Goh Chok Tong, Lee Kuan Yew’s successor, by continuing to lean into attracting big business. The next big step for Singapore is to shift its emphasis to a knowledge economy that relies more on creativity and growing Singapore's entrepreneurs.</p><ol><li>Leisure and entertainments</li></ol><p>In 2004, Lee Hsien Loong, Lee Kuan Yew's eldest son, took over the premiership. And he realized to retain the flow of business and wealth, it needed to be an even more attractive place to live in. With its prime location, Singapore had to become a destination in itself. It embarked on an ambitious land reclamation project in the 1970s. Over the years, that space was filled with not just offices and apartment buildings, but entertainment hubs, changing the city skyline in the process. The government also welcomed casinos or integrated resorts as they're called in Singapore. And the timing was impeccable because the Chinese and Indian economies were booming. Singapore was ideally situated to attract the region's ultra-wealthy, who could then enjoy the casinos and nightlife, but also park their money. This has led to the total value of assets under management in Singapore jumped from $420 billion at the start of Lee Hsien Loong's tenure to $3.6 trillion in 2022</p>
