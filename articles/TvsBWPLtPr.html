                    As Presidents of the United States, Donald Trump and Joe Biden have each steered the economy through different challenges. Though the timeframes and external factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic make direct comparisons difficult, their economic policies have left distinct marks on the country.

Though the timeframes and external factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic make direct comparisons difficult, their economic policies have left distinct marks on the country. As the 2024 presidential election approaches, voters are weighing these economic legacies to decide the future.</p><p><br /></p><h1><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/248154/quarterly-us-real-gross-domestic-product-gdp/" target="_blank">Economic Growth</a> and Investor Confidence</h1><p>Under President Trump, the U.S. economy saw strong growth, particularly before the pandemic. His administration's policies focused on tax cuts, deregulation, and America-first trade deals, which spurred investment and job creation. <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-were-economic-effects-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act#:~:text=The%20TCJA%20likely%20influenced%20the,which%20likely%20increased%20their%20spending." target="_blank">The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017</a> was a major driver, reducing the corporate tax rate and providing relief to middle-class Americans. This led to an economic boom, with the stock market reaching record highs and unemployment hitting a 50-year low.</p><p>On the other hand, President Biden inherited an economy recovering from the pandemic. While the GDP has continued to grow under his leadership, the growth has been less robust. Biden's focus on expansive government spending, higher taxes, and green energy has created a more cautious economic environment. Though Wall Street has performed well during Biden's tenure, the returns have been less spectacular than during the Trump years, overshadowed by inflation and rising interest rates, leading to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/22/poll-economy-recession-biden" target="_blank">many citizens of the US falsely accusing Biden of a recession, though that is completely delusive.</a></p><p><br /></p><h1><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/191077/inflation-rate-in-the-usa-since-1990/" target="_blank">Inflation</a> and Monetary Policy</h1><p>Inflation has been a significant issue under President Biden. When Trump left office, inflation was a manageable 1.2%, even after the economic disruptions caused by COVID-19. Trump's administration implemented generous monetary policies to cushion the economy from the pandemic's effects, such as the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/coronavirus-aid-relief-and-economic-security-cares-act-4800707" target="_blank">CARES Act</a>, which provided immediate relief to millions of Americans.</p><p>However, Biden's administration faced the inflationary consequences of these policies and the cumulative effects of over a decade of quantitative easing. Inflation soared to a peak of 9.1% in June 2022 before gradually declining. Despite efforts to control it, inflation has remained a burden for American families, diminishing purchasing power and eroding wage gains.</p><p><br /></p><h1>Employment and Job Creation</h1><p>The labor market has been another battleground for comparing these two administrations. Trump inherited an<a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/unemployment-rate" target="_blank"> unemployment rate</a> of 4.7% and successfully reduced it to 3.5% before COVID-19 struck. The pandemic caused a spike in unemployment, but Trump's economic policies laid the foundation for a swift recovery.</p><p>Under Biden, unemployment has also decreased, with job vacancies initially increasing. However, despite the higher number of job openings, public perception has been less positive. Many Americans feel that the economic outlook has dimmed under Biden, even though full-time employment has remained stable. The contrast between the booming optimism during Trump's presidency and the more subdued mood under Biden is stark.</p><p><br /></p><h1>Public Finances and Fiscal Responsibility</h1><p>Public finances have deteriorated under both administrations, but the burden has become more pronounced under Biden. <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/countries/USA/united-states/debt-to-gdp-ratio#:~:text=U.S.%20debt%20to%20gdp%20ratio%20for%202022%20was%20115.70%25%2C%20a,a%201.74%25%20increase%20from%202018." target="_blank">The national debt-to-GDP ratio</a> and federal budget deficit both increased during Trump's presidency, largely due to the pandemic. However, under Biden, these numbers have continued to climb, with the budget deficit reaching higher levels than during Trump's tenure.</p><p>Despite Biden's efforts to manage government spending and increase revenues, the budget deficit remains a pressing issue. The public, however, seems more concerned with inflation than the long-term fiscal health of the country.</p><p><br /></p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>In comparing the economic legacies of Donald Trump and Joe Biden, it is clear that Trump's policies led to a period of strong economic growth, low unemployment, and a booming stock market. While Biden has managed to maintain economic stability, his administration has struggled with inflation, public finances, and maintaining the same level of investor confidence. As voters head to the polls in November, these economic records will play a crucial role in shaping their decisions. The legacy of Trump's economic policies, marked by prosperity and growth, continues to serve as a benchmark for comparison.</p>
